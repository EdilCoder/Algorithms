# Data Structure with Code(Java & Python) 



- Coding is about working with data.
- How data is organized affects how fast a program runs.
- A data organization structure only 4 basic operations:
  - access
  - search
  - insert
  - delete
- There have 
  -  Linear Data Structures
    - Array
    - Linked List
      - Singly Linked List
      - Doubly Linked List
      - Circular Linked List
    - Stack
      - Push
      - Pop
      - Peek
    - Queue
      - Deque
      - Priority Queue
  - Non-Linear Data Structures
    - Tree
      - Binary Tree
      - Complete Binary Tree
      - Full Binary Tree
      - Binary Search Tree, BST
      - AVL Tree
      - Red-Black Tree
      - B-Tree and B+ Tree
      - Trie
      - Heap
        - Max Heap
        - Min Heap
    - Graph
      - Directed Graph and Undirected Graph
      - Weighted Graph and Unweighted Graph
      - Sparse Graph and Dense Graph
      - Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix

## Array and Set

- Array is a basic type of structure for organizing information.
